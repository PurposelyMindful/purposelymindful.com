   - "A life coach is someone who supports you, motivates you, and holds you accountable to achieving your vision for yourself. As a life coach, I aim to help you get what you want out of your life. This differs from counseling because it focuses on moving you forward rather than resolving your past. Life Coaching is not covered by most health insurance companies."
