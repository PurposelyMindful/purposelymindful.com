   - "It is simply counseling that focuses on mind, body, spirit, and purpose. I find that when clients feel they are living for a purpose, and have taken time to care for mind, body, and spirit, all kinds of unwanted emotions and experiences are decreased or eliminated. As a holistic counselor, I do not send clients immediately to a psychiatrist to receive medications. Instead, I incorporate discussion and education about physical and mental self-care practices, and core skills that may help. Most of the time, these simple practices can lead to great results without the use of medication. In the event that these life changes do not improve overall well-being, I will work with your psychiatrist to ensure the highest quality of care."
